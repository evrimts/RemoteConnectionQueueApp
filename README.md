# RemoteConnectionQueueApp
A solution for my company where lots of developers need remote connections to many customers. This app lists defined remote connections and manages a queue which users may join and leave.

*ASP.NET Core MVC

*Identity Framework to handle User Authentication

*Datatables

*Ajax API calls

*Some render operations on datatable columns to calculate connection time in minutes 
and dynamic button creation (Connect/Leave/Queue Operations) depending on whether someone already connected or not.

*Toastr, SweetAlert, Toast Notification
